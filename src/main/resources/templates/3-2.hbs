                    Like with conventional bits, when we read a qubit, we see either <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>.</h4>
                <h4 class="uk-margin-small-top">The likelihood
                    that we'll read <b>0</b> is given by the probability above the <b>0</b> circle, and same for <b>1</b>,
                    which we learned about in the <a href="/campaigns/2/3">What happens when you read a qubit?</a> section.

                    This qubit will always return 0 because the 0 probability is 100%.

                    This qubit is in a superposition where the probability of reading a 0 or 1 is 50%, respectively. So,
                    if we measure it, we're equally likely to see a 0 or 1. Note that the phase of the qubit <i>does not affect</i>
                    the probability.

                    a 1 is 16%. If we read this qubit, we're more likely to see a 0, but we could also see a 1. It's random!
