This project is being developed in parallel stages.
  - Specify object model and primitives (done)
  - Specify function options, keywords, built-in operators, which arities to allow.
  - Determine variable and primitive naming and validity rules
  - Create a list of features and functionality important to include, such as chunking lists
  - Finalize control flow and structure syntax
  - Create formal EBNF language grammar 
  - Create tokenizer specification
  - Create parser/transpiler specification


So far, object model has been created. I am currently working on determining how functions with different precedence and arity should be defined
